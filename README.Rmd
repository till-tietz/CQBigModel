`CQBigModel` is currently in development, very much experimental and may not be functional. It is intended to be a companion package to `CausalQueries`, implementing optimized core `CausalQueries` methods to make, update and query very large causal models.

[CausalQueries CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CausalQueries/index.html)
[CausalQueries GitHub](https://github.com/macartan/CausalQueries)

## Installation

You can install the development version of CQBigModel from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("till-tietz/CQBigModel")
```

## Development

#### Implemented
- generating causal models with up to n > 4 parents per child by imposing monotonicity and no-interaction restrictions 
- functionality to add interactions back to monotonicity and no-interaction models 
- updating large models via graph splitting and stitching (currently only possible without confounding and with complete data)

#### Under Development 
- space & time complexity efficient querying 
- updating via graph splitting and stitching with confounding and missing data 

#### Possible Developments 
- helpers to generate optimal graph splitting strategies
- methods for validating DAGs using data
